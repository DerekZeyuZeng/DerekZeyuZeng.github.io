**Introduction:** This is a living post where I log interesting problems and obstacles I encounter across mathematics and physics. This post is updated irregularly; a concise changelog is kept at the end.

Each entry is short and structured: statement → minimal context → current progress → references.

Status labels guide navigation:
  - **[Open]** unsolved,
  - **[WIP]** in progress,
  - **[Solved]** with a brief proof/idea,
  - **[Note]** literature or folklore.
