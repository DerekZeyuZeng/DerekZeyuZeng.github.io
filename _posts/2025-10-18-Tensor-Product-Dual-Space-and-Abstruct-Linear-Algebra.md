**Introduction**. This series upgrades familiar linear algebra into a map-centric, structure-first language. We treat vector spaces as objects determined by the linear maps they admit, define duals by the functor $\mathrm{Hom}_k(-, k)$, and characterize the tensor product by its universal property rather than by coordinates. Rings and modules extend “linearity” beyond fields, and monoidal categories distill the algebra of $\otimes$ and the unit object into a flexible, diagram-friendly framework. The throughline is simple: the most useful constructions are those specified uniquely by how maps into or out of them behave.\
The aim is taste, not encyclopedism. Each section begins with a concrete tension you likely met in first-course linear algebra (duals in infinite dimension, bilinear vs linear, change of scalars), and resolves it with a clean abstraction (universal properties, adjunctions, internal Homs). By the end, you will be able to recognize when a definition is powerful because it is characterized by morphisms, to convert bilinear problems into linear ones via $\mathrm{Hom}(U \otimes V, W) \cong \mathrm{Bil}(U \times V, W)$ and to see $\mathbf{Vect}_k$ as a symmetric closed monoidal category—the natural habitat of modern multilinear algebra.
