In the following series of notes, I records some idea about trhe projective representation and group cohomology. The question begin with my self-study of quantum field theory. In the first note, I have discussed Weinberg's approach in *The Quantum Theory of Fields*. Vol. 1, and the most general approach that classify the central extension using 2-cocycles in the second group cohomology group $H^2(G)$

And here is an exanple uses the group cohomology to classify the central extension:

The second note will be about my efforts on discribing the Lie group cohomology in a "local + global obstruction" way, i.e. we have a short exact sequence
$$
1 \longrightarrow \operatorname{Hom}\big(\pi_1(G), U(1)\big) \longrightarrow H^2\big(G, U(1)\big) \longrightarrow H^2(\mathfrak{g}, \mathbb{R}) \longrightarrow 1
$$
This part is incomplete yet and will be updated to the webpasge soon.
