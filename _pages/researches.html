  The researches page lists all entries in the `researches` collection.  Each
  entry corresponds to a publication or research project contained in the
  `_researches` directory.  Without this file, the `/researches/` permalink
  defined in `_data/navigation.yml` would return a 404 page, causing the
  "Researches" link in the site navigation to appear broken.  This page uses
  the `archive` layout to generate a list view and iterates over the
  collection with Liquid.  Adjust the order (for example, reverse) as needed.
