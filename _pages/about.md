![宁拙毋巧，宁朴毋华 —— C. N. Yang](/images/CNYang.png)
Favor substance over polish; plainness over flourish. (宁拙毋巧，宁朴毋华) —— C. N. Yang

Hello! My name is Derek Zeng, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, with a dual degree in Mathematics and Physics. My interests lie in geometry, topology, and mathematical physics—especially the topics related to symplectic geometry and quantum field theory. I enjoy rigorous mathematical formalism while also appreciating the physical intuition behind these problems.

This site is a place where I share my research, talks & presentations, personal notes, and projects. I will also post blogs related to my recent work and thinking. I hope these resources can inspire others who are exploring mathematics and physics. I also did some work on general physics (fluid dynamics, particle physics) on high school and first year in college.

Feel free to explore other sections for more details, and reach out via the contact links in the sidebar.
