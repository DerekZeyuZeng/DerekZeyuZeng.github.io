Femtoscopy offers a sensitive probe of hadron emission sources and hadronic interactions. In this paper we examine relativistic corrections to scattering phase shifts and correlation functions using the two-body Dirac equation framework. We analyze the impact of the Darwin term and spin-dependent potentials, showing that these relativistic effects, especially spin-related interactions, significantly enhance the proton-proton correlation function. These findings emphasize the necessity of including relativistic corrections for precise femtoscopic analyses. The paper was submitted to arXiv on June 24, 2025.
