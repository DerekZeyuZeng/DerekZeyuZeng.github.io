excerpt: "We introduce a minimal particle-cell model of the teapot effect that captures liquid adhesion, jet-angle change, and separation/reattachment. It quantifies how flow speed, spout geometry, wettability, and edge defects shape the outcome, providing a clean baseline for adding realistic forces and scalable computation."

This work addresses the classic “teapot effect”—the tendency of a liquid to adhere to a curved spout, curl back, and alter its ejection angle—by introducing and validating a particle-cell microphysical model. Instead of solving Navier–Stokes with intricate boundary conditions or relying on momentum-balance heuristics, we represent the liquid as interacting fluid elements with short-range repulsion/attraction, weak long-range coupling, and explicit liquid–solid adhesion. From microscopic statistics we self-consistently recover macroscopic viscosity and mean free path; time evolution then yields criteria for jetting angle, layer separation, and reattachment, allowing us to quantify how flow speed, lip thickness/curvature, wettability, and damaged edges control regime transitions.
