excerpt: "We introduce a minimal particle-cell model of the teapot effect that captures liquid adhesion, jet-angle change, and separation/reattachment. It quantifies how flow speed, spout geometry, wettability, and edge defects shape the outcome, providing a clean baseline for adding realistic forces and scalable computation."
