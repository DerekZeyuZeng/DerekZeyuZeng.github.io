excerpt: "We study the lacunary palindromic polynomial P_{a,b}(x) arising in trace fields of Dehn fillings of the figure-eight knot complement. We give explicit cyclotomic divisibility criteria (notably 2-adic conditions for Φ_{2^k} and a sharp multiplicity test for Φ_6 when a=3), and we formulate data-driven conjectures on residual irreducibility over Q and palindromic/non-palindromic factor patterns over F_2."

This report investigates the factorization behavior of the lacunary palindromic polynomial
$$
P_{a,b}(x)=x^{4b}-x^{2b}-x^{a}-2-x^{-a}-x^{-2b}+x^{-4b},
$$
and its Laurent-cleared form $Q_{a,b}(x)=x^{4b}P_{a,b}(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$, motivated by Filaseta’s description of trace fields for Dehn fillings of the figure-eight knot complement via $\mathbb{Q}(x+x^{-1})$ when $x$ is a root of $P_{a,b}$. On the rational side, we isolate uniform cyclotomic structure by evaluating at roots of unity: we give explicit 2-adic congruence criteria for when $\Phi_{2^k}(x)=x^{2^{k-1}}+1$ divides $Q_{a,b}(x)$, and prove a sharp multiplicity condition in the $a=3$ case, namely $(x^2-x+1)^2\mid P_{3,b}(x)\iff 3\mid b$. Building on extensive SageMath experiments, we formulate a global irreducibility conjecture over $\mathbb{Q}$: after removing forced factors $(x+1)^2$ (for odd $a$) and $(x^2-x+1)$ (when $3\mid a$), the remaining factor is typically irreducible for $\gcd(a,b)=1$. On the mod-2 side, we introduce a palindromic/non-palindromic trichotomy for irreducible factors in $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$ and report two clean parameter-pattern conjectures (including a “forbidden region” boundary near $b\ge a/4$ for certain $a\bmod 24$, and a residue-class characterization involving parity and $a\bmod 3$). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
