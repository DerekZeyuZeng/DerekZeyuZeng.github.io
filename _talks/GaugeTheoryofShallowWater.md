We present the striking parallels between shallow-water dynamics and electromagnetism (EM), and show how gauge-theoretic structures arise naturally in ocean physics following David Tongâ€™s work ([arXiv:2209.10574](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10574)). Topics include the mapping between vorticity/divergence and EM fields, the role of Coriolis effects as effective sources, conserved currents and Bianchi-type identities, and the gauge interpretation of boundary conditions. We also discuss the physical link between the chiral Kelvin mode and large-scale ocean circulation patterns, clarifying when and how the gauge perspective yields testable consequences for geophysical flows.
