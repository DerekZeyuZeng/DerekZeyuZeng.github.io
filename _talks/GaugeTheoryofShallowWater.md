We presents striking similarities between shallow water currents and E&M fields, and cover how some of the conclusions of gauge
theory are naturally derived into ocean physics based on David Tong's paper <i> arXiv:2209.10574 <i>, such as the physical relation beneath the chiral mode of Kelvin wave and global ocean current patterns.
