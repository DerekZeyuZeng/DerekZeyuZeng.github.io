excerpt： “We present a unified construction of isotropic coordinates for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes

$$
\mathrm{d}s^{2}= f(r)\mathrm{d}t^{2}+f(r)^{-1}\mathrm{d}r^{2}+r^{2}\mathrm{d}\Omega^{2}
$$

yielding the conformally flat spatial form 

$$
\mathrm{d}s^{2}=-F(\rho)\mathrm{d}t^{2}+G(\rho)(\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\mathrm{d}y^{2}+\mathrm{d}z^{2})
$$

The key step is the general transformation

$$
\rho=\rho_{0}\exp \int \frac{\mathrm{d}r}{r\sqrt{f(r)}}
$$

from which we obtain closed forms for Schwarzschild and Reissner–Nordström and elliptic-integral expressions for Kottler \\(\Lambda \neq 0\\); extensions to Kiselev-type fluids are outlined.
These explicit formulas enable clean, conformally flat initial data across near-horizon to cosmological scales and streamline boundary and matching conditions in \\(3{+}1\\) numerical relativity.”
