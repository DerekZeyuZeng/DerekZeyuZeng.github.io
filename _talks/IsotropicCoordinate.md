We present a unified construction of isotropic coordinates for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes $ds^{2}=-f(r)\,dt^{2}+f(r)^{-1}dr^{2}+r^{2}d\Omega^{2}$, yielding the conformally flat spatial form $ds^{2}=-F(\rho)\,dt^{2}+G(\rho)(dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2})$.
The key step is the general transformation $\displaystyle \rho=\rho_{0}\exp\!\int \frac{dr}{r\sqrt{f(r)}}$, from which we obtain closed forms for Schwarzschild and Reissner–Nordström and elliptic-integral expressions for Kottler ($\Lambda\neq0$); extensions to Kiselev-type fluids are outlined.
These explicit formulas enable clean, conformally flat initial data across near-horizon–to–cosmological scales and streamline boundary and matching conditions in $3{+}1$ numerical relativity.
