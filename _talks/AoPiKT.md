For the figure-eight knot complement, the trace field of the $(-a/b)$ Dehn filling can be expressed as $\mathbb{Q}(x+x^{-1})$, where $x$ is a root of the Laurent polynomial
\[
P_{a,b}(x)=x^{4b}-x^{2b}-x^{a}-2-x^{-a}-x^{-2b}+x^{-4b}.
\]

We study the arithmetic of these Dehn-filling trace fields via the factorization behavior of $P_{a,b}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ and over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Over $\mathbb{Q}$, we use evaluations at cyclotomic roots together with Euler-type expansions to obtain explicit congruence conditions on $(a,b)$ guaranteeing that certain $2$-power cyclotomic polynomials divide $P_{a,b}$. In the odd-$a$ regime, we isolate low-degree ``trivial'' factors---in particular the ubiquitous divisor $(x+1)^2$ and, when $3\mid a$, an additional quadratic cyclotomic factor---and formulate a refined irreducibility conjecture for the remaining quotient for $\gcd(a,b)=1$, supported by extensive computations for $1\le a\le 1000$ and $1\le b\le 200$.

Working modulo $2$, we introduce a symmetry dichotomy for polynomials satisfying $p(x)=x^{\deg p}p(1/x)$ and classify irreducible factors as symmetric or as members of asymmetric reciprocal pairs. Empirically, the resulting factorization types exhibit strong congruence patterns in $(a,b)$, including conditions that force multiple asymmetric irreducible factors and a parity criterion characterizing the ``all-asymmetric'' regime. Finally, we outline a trigonometric reformulation of cyclotomic specializations, leading to the constraint $\cos(4b\theta)-\cos(2b\theta)-\cos(a\theta)-1=0$, which suggests a pathway toward a systematic description of cyclotomic divisors of $P_{a,b}$.
